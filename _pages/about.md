Hello there, Iâ€™m an computer engineering graduate from Pulchowk Campus, Institure of Engineering, Nepal. I currenty work at NAAMII under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDEi58sAAAAJ'>Dr. Binod Bhattarai</a>. I am working at the forefront of medical imaging and its applications through computer vision and AI. My current research focuses on Out-of-Distribution detection in gastrointestinal vision in various modalities. I also lead a project on automatic coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in angiographic images in two hospitals in Nepal. My research interests are in OOD detection, Multimodal learning, Adversarial robustness, Object detection and Image segmentation. 
Research Interests: OOD detection, Multimodal learning, Adversarial robustness, Object detection and Image segmentation
